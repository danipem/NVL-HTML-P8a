<h2>Primera parte (bien)</h2>

<p>After the battle is over
And the sands <strong>drunken the blood</strong>
All what there <em>remains</em>
Is the bitterness of delusion</p>

<p>The <span>immortality of the gods</span>
Sits <a href="https://www.musica.com/letras.asp?letra=21771">at their side</a>
As they leave the walls behind
To reach the jewels gleam</p>

<div>The days have come
When the <b>steel will rule</b>
And upon his head
A crown of gold</div>

<h2>Última parte (mal)</h2>

<p>Your hand wields the might
The tyrant's <p>the precursor</p>
You carry the will
As the morning is near</p>

<p>I sing the ballads
Of victory <ol>and defeat
I hear the tales</ol>
Of frozen mystery</p>
